	abstract = {Lassa fever is a longstanding public health concern in West Africa. Recent molecular studies have confirmed the fundamental role of the rodent host (Mastomys natalensis) in driving human infections, but control and prevention efforts remain hampered by a limited baseline understanding of the disease’s true incidence, geographical distribution and underlying drivers. Here, we show that Lassa fever occurrence and incidence is influenced by climate, poverty, agriculture and urbanisation factors. However, heterogeneous reporting processes and diagnostic laboratory access also appear to be important drivers of the patchy distribution of observed disease incidence. Using spatiotemporal predictive models we show that including climatic variability added retrospective predictive value over a baseline model (11\% decrease in out-of-sample predictive error). However, predictions for 2020 show that a climate-driven model performs similarly overall to the baseline model. Overall, with ongoing improvements in surveillance there may be potential for forecasting Lassa fever incidence to inform health planning.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever ({LF}), an often-fatal hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus ({LASV}), is a major public health threat in West Africa. When the violent civil conflict in Sierra Leone (1991 to 2002) ended, an international consortium assisted in restoration of the {LF} program at Kenema Government Hospital ({KGH}) in an area with the world's highest incidence of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings Clinical and laboratory records of patients presenting to the {KGH} Lassa Ward in the post-conflict period were organized electronically. Recombinant antigen-based {LF} immunoassays were used to assess {LASV} antigenemia and {LASV}-specific antibodies in patients who met criteria for suspected {LF}. {KGH} has been reestablished as a center for {LF} treatment and research, with over 500 suspected cases now presenting yearly. Higher case fatality rates ({CFRs}) in {LF} patients were observed compared to studies conducted prior to the civil conflict. Different criteria for defining {LF} stages and differences in sensitivity of assays likely account for these differences. The highest incidence of {LF} in Sierra Leone was observed during the dry season. {LF} cases were observed in ten of Sierra Leone's thirteen districts, with numerous cases from outside the traditional endemic zone. Deaths in patients presenting with {LASV} antigenemia were skewed towards individuals less than 29 years of age. Women self-reporting as pregnant were significantly overrepresented among {LASV} antigenemic patients. The {CFR} of ribavirin-treated patients presenting early in acute infection was lower than in untreated subjects. Conclusions/Significance Lassa fever remains a major public health threat in Sierra Leone. Outreach activities should expand because {LF} may be more widespread in Sierra Leone than previously recognized. Enhanced case finding to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment is imperative to reduce mortality. Even with ribavirin treatment, there was a high rate of fatalities underscoring the need to develop more effective and/or supplemental treatments for {LF}.},
